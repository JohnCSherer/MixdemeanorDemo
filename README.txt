Demo for an ongoing videogame project. Friend of mine does the art and character design.

Movement is controlled with the WASD keys, and the J key is used to interact. The cursor is used to choose between dialogue options, and some characters will follow you around when asked!

The game features a dynamic text interpreter that reads 'scripts', which are just very simple .txt files that can be found in "Assets/Resources/Dialogue Scripts". The interpreter processes these at runtime with full error handling, producing text and loading up the next 'script'.
